      "When you get a new cat, it's in some ways like having a newborn child in your house. There's a change in the atmosphere; it's both exciting and a bit tense. What can I do? What can't I do? How much of my life and freedom is compromised? Often there are more questions than you can handle. But we've done this hundreds of times (no exaggeration). Let's break this down.",
      "Typically, onboarding a new cat is a 3-week process. Don't be thrown off by that; it's the first week that's the longest, and things get easier dramatically after that. That said, each cat is unique and each onboarding is therefore unique. We'll help you through it, no matter what.",

          "Cats need their time and space. Your new cat has just been uprooted from everything familiar; the smells, the sounds, the people it knew. It's now in a completely alien environment, and its instinct is to hide. This is completely normal.",
          "Don't be alarmed if your cat disappears into a cupboard, under a bed, or behind a sofa and refuses to come out. They may not emerge even if they're hungry. Cats can go a day or two without eating when stressed; survival mode kicks in and food becomes secondary to safety. Place some food and water near (but not too close to) their hiding spot, and then leave the room. Let them be. Resist the urge to coax them out or peek in repeatedly; every time you do, you reset their anxiety clock."
        ],
        "tip": "Before you bring your cat home, set up a small, quiet room as their safe room; we call this the \"Basecamp\". A bathroom or a spare bedroom works well. Keep the litter tray, food, water, and a cosy hiding spot (even a cardboard box with a blanket) all in this one room. This becomes their world for the first few days."

          "Today, try sitting quietly in the room. Don't approach them, don't make sudden movements, don't stare directly at them (cats find prolonged eye contact threatening). Just exist in their space. Read a book, scroll through your phone, or simply sit still. Let them observe you. They're learning: is this person safe?",

        ],
        "tip": "Speak softly when you're in the room. They need to know what you sound like. A calm, low voice helps them associate you with safety. Avoid high-pitched excitement or loud conversations near them; make slow movements, keep your voice gentle. They're learning you just as much as you're learning them."

          "This is a good time to let them explore the rest of your home, but do it strategically. Best to let them out when the house is quiet; when other family members are either out or sitting still, not moving about much. The cat will explore, explore, explore. Every corner, every piece of furniture, every strange smell. This can take hours, and they might retreat back to their safe room several times. That's okay. It's a process of expanding their territory in small, manageable doses."

          "Whatever the case, this phase is a test of patience; believe us, this goes for both human and cat. They're getting used to your schedules: when you wake up, when you leave, when you return, when you sleep. They're learning the rhythms of your household. And you're learning theirs.",
          "You might find them sleeping in unexpected places, demanding food at 4 AM, or suddenly zooming across the house for no apparent reason (this is normal; it's called the \"zoomies\"). Embrace it. This is your cat figuring out how to live with you."

They refuse to come out of hiding for a whole day. They stop using the litter tray. It feels like all your work has been undone.",
          "It hasn't. This is completely normal.",
          "This doesn't mean all the work has been undone; it's just that this is a non-linear process. Just like with human children, cats take their time to learn their new environment, their new habits, their new behaviours. There will be setbacks. A loud noise might spook them. A new visitor might reset their anxiety. A change in your schedule might throw them off.",
          "Ride this one through. Don't panic, don't get frustrated, and most importantly, don't give up. They will internalise what they've learnt. The setbacks become smaller and less frequent. One day, you'll realise you can't remember the last time they hid from you."

          "By this time, most of the bumps are behind you. Your cat knows where the food is, where the litter is, where the best napping spots are. It knows your voice, your footsteps, your smell. And you know its quirks, its preferences, its little ways of asking for attention.",
